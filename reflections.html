           <h2>Reflection 1 / 11 September 2025</h2>

    <p> Photographs hold captive both our minds and reality itself. As Susan Sontag states in “On Photography,” “to collect photographs is to collect the world.” When we take photographs, we are given the chance to simultaneously capture what is real while imbuing our own unique consciousness. This constant presence of truth is what isolates photography from other art forms and makes it so fascinating. 
 </p>

     <br>

           <p>When working creatively, photography offers itself as a basis to influence other artistic pursuits. A photograph is often a reference point. Real imagery guides the process of representing truth through illustration. It aids us in reproducing accurately things that we really should remember, but cannot always due to the limits of our visual memories. Photography adds an element of accessibility to visual art that was not always present. You can create anything from anywhere in a technological age that makes us privy to images all the time. The mind cannot be trusted to illustrate all the gory details of a moment which it has only once bore witness to, but a photograph can. This helps the visual artist grasp reality more firmly. Or alternatively, for the opposite to occur. To be subversive, we first have to know the authenticity of what we are subverting against. Sontag expresses that taking a photo is “as simple as turning the ignition key or pulling the trigger.” The bias we concurrently inject into images is what makes the use of a camera both dangerous and at times, beautiful. We know what we know through the hearts of others. 
           </p>

              <br>
           <p>
             When we create film, one image becomes hundreds becomes tens of thousands of photos, reflecting both narrative and documentary scenarios. Sontag states that, “photographs may be more memorable than moving images, because they are a neat slice of time, not a flow” and simultaneously expresses that said film images are often “underselected.” This observation is apt and Sontag proves her point well. While still photography may, more often than not, possess more poignancy than film, we can only hope that a skilled and intentional filmmaker is able to grasp some of this poignancy and elevate it through their own medium. I personally find our manmade ability to capture the “flow” of time like this to be a powerful vehicle. It is a capability to expand an isolated precious moment into a series of them that we can better understand humanity and ourselves through. It offers a plethora of even more opportunities to expose difficult truths, tell beautiful stories, and manipulate what we know as reality in unique, enthralling, and grotesque ways. About photographs, Sontag writes that “they are attempts to contact or lay claim to another reality.” I think that motion pictures offer an equal if not at times more compelling attempt to do so. Regardless, before the cameraperson presses record, they point their camera towards a single image. 
           </p>

           <br>

           <p>
             Photography is a weapon of reality, unreality, growth, and stagnation. It is distant yet at times, unbearably close to us. How we wield this weapon is personal to each individual user.

              <h2>Reflection 2 / 16 October 2025</h2>
           <p> The rise of AI and subsequent AI slop is frightening to me on a fundamental level. This year, I made a conscious decision to stop using most social media platforms and to start living a more offline life. AI slop factored into this decision for me. Despite this, I have never been anti-technology and I have always had a love for the digital world. Throughout my life, the internet has been a safe space for me: a place where I could see my own humanity easily reflected back on myself, despite all of its dangers and misgivings. I trusted the online world in a way that I can’t anymore. As Nesrine Malik states in the Guardian article “With ‘AI Slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster,” “You are immersed deeper and deeper into subjective worlds rather than objective reality.” We as humans have trained machines to think and create on our behalves in very sinister ways.

 </p>
           <br>

           <p> Generative AI images are inherently dangerous and political. Even if it is an image of something innocuous, it is poisonous because nothing about it is real. A human had no part in it, sans training the machine to have such capabilities. We are thus accustoming ourselves to see humanity where it is not. If anything, it is these innocuous images that are the scariest. I myself have seen images of people, even, that were so detailed I either had no idea it was AI or I felt very uncertain. If AI is already this skilled, could we be looking at a future where human art and machine art are entirely indistinguishable? 
</p>
<br>
           <p> This is why, in my opinion, creating art right now is more important than ever, not just to combat the culture, but for our personal well-being. There is a radical sense of agency in creation when we now live in a world that requires it less and less. 

</p>
<br>
           <p> When the power of AI injects itself into blatantly political situations, it has the power to alter consciousness and morality in a significant way. Malik writes that “Generative AI is trained on pre-existing data, which research has shown is inherently biased against ethnic diversity, progressive gender roles and sexual orientations, therefore concentrating those norms in the output.” It is a political brainwashing tactic of unheard of proportions, because it has massive reach and preys on our human sense of trust in a way that we do not yet have adequate practice discerning against. For people of the older generation, who already understandably have trouble evaluating online content, the significance of this is tenfold. Fascist ideals are propagating the online ecosystem, redefining societal norms, and planting seeds of conservatism in the minds of vulnerable people. Meanwhile, important social concerns are lost more and more in the clutter of it all, as Malik says, “The sense of urgency and action that our crisis-torn world should inspire is […] blunted by how information is presented.” 
</p>
             <br> 
           <p> I fear the long-term effects of this new information economy and mourn the digital landscape of the past. In the face of it all, we must challenge ourselves to be human.
