<h2>Reflection 1 / 11 September 2025</h2>

<p> 
Photographs hold captive both our minds and reality itself. As Susan Sontag states in “On Photography,” “to collect photographs is to collect the world.” When we take photographs, we are given the chance to simultaneously capture what is real while imbuing our own unique consciousness. This constant presence of truth is what isolates photography from other art forms and makes it so fascinating. 
When working creatively, photography offers itself as a basis to influence other artistic pursuits. A photograph is often a reference point. Real imagery guides the process of representing truth through illustration. It aids us in reproducing accurately things that we really should remember, but cannot always due to the limits of our visual memories. Photography adds an element of accessibility to visual art that was not always present. You can create anything from anywhere in a technological age that makes us privy to images all the time. The mind cannot be trusted to illustrate all the gory details of a moment which it has only once bore witness to, but a photograph can. This helps the visual artist grasp reality more firmly. Or alternatively, for the opposite to occur. To be subversive, we first have to know the authenticity of what we are subverting against. Sontag expresses that taking a photo is “as simple as turning the ignition key or pulling the trigger.” The bias we concurrently inject into images is what makes the use of a camera both dangerous and at times, beautiful. We know what we know through the hearts of others. 
When we create film, one image becomes hundreds becomes tens of thousands of photos, reflecting both narrative and documentary scenarios. Sontag states that, “photographs may be more memorable than moving images, because they are a neat slice of time, not a flow” and simultaneously expresses that said film images are often “underselected.” This observation is apt and Sontag proves her point well. While still photography may, more often than not, possess more poignancy than film, we can only hope that a skilled and intentional filmmaker is able to grasp some of this poignancy and elevate it through their own medium. I personally find our manmade ability to capture the “flow” of time like this to be a powerful vehicle. It is a capability to expand an isolated precious moment into a series of them that we can better understand humanity and ourselves through. It offers a plethora of even more opportunities to expose difficult truths, tell beautiful stories, and manipulate what we know as reality in unique, enthralling, and grotesque ways. About photographs, Sontag writes that “they are attempts to contact or lay claim to another reality.” I think that motion pictures offer an equal if not at times more compelling attempt to do so. Regardless, before the cameraperson presses record, they point their camera towards a single image. 
Photography is a weapon of reality, unreality, growth, and stagnation. It is distant yet at times, unbearably close to us. How we wield this weapon is personal to each individual user.
