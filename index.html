<p> 
I am a media studies student at Hunter College. My work is centred around exploring how physical and digital media forms can converge and act as infinite vehicles for storytelling. I desire to expand the breadth of a moment for as long as possible and manipulate it in both mundane and experimental ways. In a digital landscape that can be oversaturated and apathetic, I want to shed light on the beautiful authenticities that hide themselves within. I have experience using the software Touch Designer and have proficiency in C++ and Java programming languages.
